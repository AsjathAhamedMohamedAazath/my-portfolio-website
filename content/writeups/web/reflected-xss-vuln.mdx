# ⚠️ Reflected XSS in Login Page

While testing a login endpoint, I found a reflected XSS vulnerability in the `redirect_url` parameter.

---

## 🔍 PoC – Proof of Concept

The vulnerable URL was:

```
https://example.com/login?redirect_url=javascript:alert(1)
```

When the login page rendered, the `redirect_url` parameter was reflected into the DOM without proper sanitization or encoding.

<Note>Any unsanitized input directly inserted into `window.location` or HTML can become a vector for XSS.</Note>

## 🔬 Root Cause

The server was dynamically inserting the `redirect_url` parameter into a `<script>` block:

```
<script>
  window.location = "${redirect_url}";
</script>
```

If a user inputs JavaScript in the query string, the browser interprets and executes it.

## ✅ Fix Recommendation

- Whitelist only trusted redirect domains or paths.
- Escape and validate all input values rendered in HTML or JavaScript context.
- Use a framework-level sanitizer to prevent XSS injection.

## 🛡️ Impact

- Could allow attackers to steal cookies or session tokens.
- Possibility of phishing attacks by disguising malicious URLs.
- Users could be redirected to external malicious sites.

## 📌 Disclosure Timeline

1. March 3: Vulnerability discovered
2. March 4: Reported via bug bounty platform
3. March 5: Acknowledged and fixed by the security team

## 🔚 Conclusion

Reflected XSS is often overlooked, but it's a real threat. Always validate user input, especially on pages involving redirects or dynamic content.

<Note>Use tools like Burp Suite, Param Miner, and manual fuzzing to detect reflected XSS vectors.</Note>
