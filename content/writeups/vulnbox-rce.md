# Overview

This walkthrough demonstrates how to exploit a Remote Code Execution vulnerability on a web application.

## Recon

We started by scanning the target with `nmap` and found port 443 open, running HTTPS:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p 443 -oA vulnbox-rce 10.10.10.10
```

Scan Results:

- Port 80: HTTP service running on Apache
- No authentication on the web interface
- Potential user input via a diagnostic utility
